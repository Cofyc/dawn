About ejoy2d
====

Ejoy2d is a open source cross-platform 2d game engine. The engine is written in c but provides a efficient lua binding. Check the [homepage](https://github.com/ejoy/ejoy2d) for more information.

About resource packing
====

Ejoy2d does not support creating sprite from image file, so we must pack all assets to a package with specific format. [Simplepacker](https://github.com/skykapok/simplepacker) is a easy way to do this work.
